# Portfolio Website

This portfolio was coded in React. Because function based React components are the modern approach, 
I used them and their included hooks to implement component state, when necessary (mostly for handling 
animation transitions). Browser routing is accomplished via the react-router-dom package that allows 
your webapp to traverse URLs without reloading the app.

The slide/fade animations utilize an NPM package known as react-transition-group, which includes 
a CSS animation suite ideal for implementing these visuals into React projects. They even work 
when transitioning between separate URLs within the web app, something traditional PHP-based 
websites would likely not be able to accomplish.

The included demos focus on server-side programming in Node.js. For those interested, their 
code (as well as the code for this website) is available on GitHub via their respective pages.
